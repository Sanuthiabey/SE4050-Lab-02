What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

With very few hidden nodes, the network doesn’t have enough parameters to capture the underlying patterns in the data, so it underfits and yields low accuracy.
Increasing the number of hidden nodes raises the model’s capacity to represent more complex relationships, so it usually fits the data better and accuracy improves.



Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?

When you add more hidden nodes, accuracy first goes up, then stays almost the same after a point, and if you add too many, the model can get worse because it starts memorizing instead of learning.
